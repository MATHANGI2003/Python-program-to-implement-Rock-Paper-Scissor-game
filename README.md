** Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python**

**Description***

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game. The game allows a user to play against the computer. The player chooses one of three options (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer randomly selects its choice. The program then determines the winner based on the traditional rules of the game.

**Rules of the Game**:
- **Rock** beats **Scissors**.
- **Scissors** beats **Paper**.
- **Paper** beats **Rock**.

If both the player and the computer make the same choice, it results in a tie.

 **Features**:
- Player can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Computer's choice is randomly generated.
- Result of each round is displayed (Winner or Tie).
- The game can be played for multiple rounds.

## Installation

Ensure that you have **Python 3.x** installed on your machine. To check, run:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is installed, download or clone this repository, and you can start the game by running the Python script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors.git
cd rock-paper-scissors
```

## How to Run

Once the repository is cloned or downloaded, navigate to the folder containing the Python script and run it:

```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```

This will start the game in your terminal or command prompt.

## Game Instructions

1. Upon running the game, the program will prompt the user to select an option:
   - Type `rock` to select Rock.
   - Type `paper` to select Paper.
   - Type `scissors` to select Scissors.
   
2. The program will then randomly select a choice for the computer.

3. The program will display the choices of both the player and the computer, and then announce the result of the round:
   - "You win!" if the player's choice beats the computer's.
   - "You lose!" if the computer's choice beats the player's.
   - "It's a tie!" if both choices are the same.

4. The player can choose to play again or exit.

## Example

```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!

Choose one: rock, paper, or scissors: rock

You chose rock!
The computer chose scissors.
You win!

Do you want to play again? (yes/no): yes

Choose one: rock, paper, or scissors: paper

You chose paper!
The computer chose rock.
You win!

Do you want to play again? (yes/no): no

Thanks for playing!
```

## Code Structure

- `rock_paper_scissors.py`: The main Python script containing the logic for the game.
- `choices`: A list containing the possible options for the game (`rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`).
- `play_game()`: The main function that runs the game, handles the input, and determines the winner.
